"Smack Pie"
<p class="main">
<br>
a premade crust you'll first arrange<br>
if you're averse to kneading<br>
otherwise, another source<br>
than mine you must be reading<br>
<br>
next some extra virgin oil<br>
with brush or tow'l, but lo<br>
into the soggy land of oily<br>
swamp you're not to go<br>
<br>
halve a pear, remove the seed<br>
and slice it to its thinnest<br>
arrange it on your waiting crust<br>
as loveliest to witness<br>
<br>
mozzarella fresh as day<br>
goes next onto the pie<br>
but not too much for subtle flavors<br>
slabs would sure belie<br>
<br>
last a smack of ham you'll add<br>
where this dish gets its name<br>
deli sliced, and chop it small<br>
and herbs would not be lame<br>
<br>
keep it light, the size and spread<br>
of both the spice and meat<br>
for too much would defeat the taste<br>
of fruit and cheese and wheat<br>
<br>
and finally an oven heated<br>
to four hundred and fifty<br>
and fifteen minutes time creates<br>
a sight that's truly nifty<br>
<br>
the dough and moz and pear and ham<br>
through alchemy and heat<br>
have made an aw'fly special pie<br>
it now is time to eat!<br>
